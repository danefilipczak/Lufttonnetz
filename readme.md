This is a WebGL app for visualizing the 3D neo-Riemannian Tonnetz, a geometrical model of triad relationships.

# About
The grid of notes in the corner is a two-dimensional Tonnetz. It's made from rows of perfect fifths and columns of major thirds. When each cell is divided diagonally, the vertices of the resulting triangle are the notes of either a major (+) or minor (-) triad.
The 6x6 Tonnetz shown can be extended infinitely in all directions. A 12x6 Tonnetz has the interesting property that its vertical and horizontal edges can be glued together, yielding a torus - that's what the giant floating donut is. The app allows you to navigate the donut, making harmonic progressions on the way.
